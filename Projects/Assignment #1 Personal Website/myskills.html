                <h3>My Skills</h3>
                <p> Thanks to my family, I learned from a young age how to
                    cook for myself and I enjoy doing it although I hate
                    washing dishes. I almost always end up cooking chicken
                    since there is always chicken thighs in my freezer. The
                    thing that I enjoy the most to make is cake and brownies
                    and my favorite dish to eat is Teriyaki. </p>
