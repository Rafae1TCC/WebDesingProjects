                <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
                <p> I have loved videogames since i've had memory. I've
                    been playing them for years and I always dreamed of becoming
                    a game developer and having my own gaming setup just like
                    the youtubers i'd look up to. Finally, two years ago I managed
                    to save up enough money to buy and build one of the coolests setups
                    i've seen and I am very proud of it. Now that I have my gaming setup
                    finished, I only need to focus on my studies and I'll eventually start
                    developing my own game. </p>
